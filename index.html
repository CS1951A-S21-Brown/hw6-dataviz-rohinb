        Written Questions:
        <br>
        1. In the top left graph, I show my boss the total number of football games played each year with a bar chart. My
        boss can
        adjust which years they want to see with the slider. In the map graph on the right, I show the winning percentages
        of each nation.
        I filter out nations with very few games in the data set. The top 10 nations are colored red, while other nations
        are colored
        a shade of purple based on their winning percentage (higher is darker). Gray nations have no or very little data. My
        boss can hover over nations to see their winning percentages.
        The last two world cups with data in the dataset (2018 and 2019) is shown in the bottom left. I chose to show total
        number
        of wins because I feel like that was the best metric to show performance in both world cups. Since teams that make
        it further
        in the world cup play more games, I felt like this was a better metric than winning percentage or average strength
        of victory.
        To have more data, I included wins in World Cup Qualification matches.
        <br>
        2. D3 was helpful to me because: it provided a lot of graphing utility for me so I mainly had to focus on processing
        the data
        without having to worry about the graphing UI very much. It also has very easy color functionality with
        brighter/darker
        methods to convert colors (like I did in my map chart). It also does very smart and intuitive scaling and animation
        of the
        graphs in the webpage and size of the window.
        <br>
        3. D3 might not have been the best visualization tool because I didn't necessarily need a web page to show my
        visualizations.
        I could have simply done the graphs locally on my machine, perhaps with some python graphing library. This brings me
        to my second reason, data processing/sorting is a little less convenient to do in javascript (compared to something
        like python)
        even though D3 has excellent utility methods. D3 also has pretty big potential functionality and customizability,
        but
        lacks default, automated visualization that a lot of lighter-weight non-web libraries offer, like matplotlib+pandas.
        This made
        me have to explicitly do everything which is good for customizability but may not be the best if I'm trying to
        make a deadline and simply need graphs.
        <br>
        4. My map chart on the right may be hard to use for someone physically impaired and using assistive technologies
        because in order to show the winning percentages of each country, it required that they hover over each country.
        Spotting the top 10 countries on the map should still be easy because of their bright red color, but of course,
        seeing the exact winning percentage would still need a hover. For a color blind user, they may not pick up the
        differences in shade of purple, but this is a much less important part of the graph and they should still be able to hover.
        My two bar charts should be pretty accessible to most because I chose to show the counts next to each bar. Also,
        I use significant padding between the bars. Also the bars are on a solid white background providing significant contrast.
        There is no hover component that would prevent users using assistive technologies from interacting. The font sizes
        may be too small in some areas of the dashboard however, preventing visually impaired users from fully reading
        the labels. The slider in the top left may be hard to manipulate for users using assistive technologies because it
        is double-ended and in general sliders are not recommended for accessibility (according to the betterment article).
        <br>
        5. When deciding to use a hover component in the map, an alternative I could think of was displaying numbers on
        each country, but I decided that would quickly become too compact to read, and some countries are quite small. As
        far as font size goes, I felt like I had to use those font sizes to fit all of that data on a single page dashboard that
        the assignment demanded, but a more accessible thing to do could have been a longer scrollable dashboard with perhaps
        multiple pages. I considered using a dropdown for the top left graph instead of a slider, but then decided that
        I'd want my boss to have more control of the granularity. Also, the dropdown, while easier to use with assistive
        technology (according to the betterment article), does not give the user the ability to select different sizes of
        ranges, though I could have built a more complicated interface if I wanted to optimize for this physically impaired
        target audience.
